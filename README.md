# Recipe Tracker
Meteor app for writing down your recipes.

No social functions. Mobile last. Three functions:
* Record a recipe
* List recipes
* View a recipe

##Roadmap:
1. Make notes to go along with them.
1. Iterate on them (version control) with notes per version
1. Photos per version
1. Copy recipe from another user - "I made this too" - and add your notes/photo etc
1. Work out measures and materials - parse "450g pork shoulder' into { measure: '450g', material: 'pork shoulder'} and then do recipe search

This is a Meteor project.
